# Book Managment App
# Node-Sequelize Back-end
    Features
  Crud For an Author.
  Crud For library.
  Crud For Book.
      Goal
The books are related to Authors in a way that a single Author could have many
books but a book can only belong to 1 Author. The books are related to a library in a way that a
single book may belong to multiple libraries and a library may have multiple books. A book is
always related to an author but it is possible it does not belong to any library.
